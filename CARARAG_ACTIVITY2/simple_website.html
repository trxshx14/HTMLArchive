    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

    <p>This paragraph incorporates some of the text formatting styles in HTML. <b>The bold tag is incorporated in this sentence</b>, <i>while the<br> italicized tag is used in this section of the sentence</i>. The<tt> monospace tag</tt> is rarely used in building websites; it's usually the <b>bold text,<br></b> <i>italicized,</i> and <u>underlined text</u> that are mostly used.</p>
